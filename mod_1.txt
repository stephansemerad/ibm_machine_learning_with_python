Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

# Definition of ML
"computer the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed"

# Regression / Estimation 
- Predicting continuous values

# Classification
- Predicting the item class or category

# Clustering
- finding the structure of the data; summarization

# Assoication
- Associating frequent co-occurring items / events

# Anomaly Detection
- Discovering Abnormal and unusual cases

# Sequence Mining
- Predicting next events; click-steam (Markov Model, HMM)

# Dimension Reduction
- Reducing the size of data (PCAw)

# Recommendation Systems. 
- Recommending items

# What is the difference between (AI , ML, and Deep Learning)
- AI : AI tries to make computers intelligent in order to mimic cognitive functions of humans 
- Machine Learnin : Statistical part (Learning from previous data and from that data make a decision )
- Deep Learning: Computers actually learn and make decisions on their own.


Supervised vs Unsupervised Algorithms
- Supervised (Observe, and direct the execution of as task, project and activity)

-- Atributes, Features, Observation. 

-- AtributesNumeric, or Categorical
-- 2 Types of Supervised Learning, Classification and Regression
-- Unsupervised ML : Dimension reduction, Density Estimation, Market Basket Analysis, Clustering
